## Be mindful of your language. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable in your game:

- Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, gender orientation, race, ethnicity, - language, neuro-type, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
- Threats of violence
- Deliberate intimidation
- Gender explicit or violent material
- Unwelcome gender attention
- Or any other kinds of harassment
- Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not put in your game.

Be respectful. Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.

<br>

Be considerate. Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.

<br>

Be open minded. Embrace new people and new ideas.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, I ask that you report it by emailing. Please include your name and a description of the incident, and I will get back to you ASAP.
