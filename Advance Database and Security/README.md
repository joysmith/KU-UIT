Define data mart, Relational vs NoSQL databases (document, key-value, graph, columnar), Distributed databases:
fragmentation, replication, CAP theorem, Cloud database systems (Firebase, AWS RDS), Case studies and comparison
frameworks

### UNIT 2: EVALUATION OF DATABASE SECURITY MECHANISMS AND SECURITY ISSUES

Control (DAC), Non- Discretionary Access Control, Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Role Based Access Control
(RBAC).
Threat models and attack surfaces, SQL injection & hardening, How SQL Injection Works? Security policy design, Auditing
and intrusion detection systems.

Common vulnerabilities: SQLi - malicious SQL code injection, Bypass Authentication. XSS Attack, malicious scripts
injection, stealing cookies, phishing attack. Buffer overflows, Remote code execution, Access Control Bypasses, DoS Attack.
OWASP Top 10 for databases - Broken Authentication and Access Control, Security Misconfiguration, Insufficient Logging
& Monitoring. Risk analysis, Risk Prioritization, Evaluation of severity of Risk, Risk mitigation strategies. Threat modelling,
Threat prioritization, STRIDE & DREAD Model (risk scoring). Vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., SQLMap, OpenVAS),
Mitigation techniques (Access control, monitoring and logging). security testing.

### UNIT 4: APPLICATION OF NOSQL AND CLOUD DATABASE SYSTEMS

NoSQL DBs, CRUD operations, MongoDB (Document based) & Cassandra (tabular/column format), setup, queries, Polyglot
persistence (Multidatabase). Cloud databases: use cases in web/mobile apps, Backend Integration, Scalability, availability
trade-offs (CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance), Hands-on demos, schema design and small project
