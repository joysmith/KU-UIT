### UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING & C++ BASICS

Problem definition, Algorithm, and flow chart, Basic concepts of programming, Introduction to C++, OOP concepts; Class
and Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, C++ syntax, structure of a program, comments, Variables,
constants, data types, Operators and expressions (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational), Input/output using cin and cout.

### UNIT 2: CONTROL FLOW AND ITERATION

Decision-Making Constructs: Introduction to conditional statements, if Statement: Syntax and flow, if-else Statement:
Branching logic, Nested if Statements: Multi-level conditions, switch Case Statement: Multi-way decision making. Looping
Constructs â€“ Introduction and Use Cases, Concept and need for loops in programming, Entry-controlled and exit-controlled
loops, for Loop, while Loop, do-while loop, Differences from while and for loops, Jumping Statements; break: Premature exit
from loop/switch, continue: Skip current iteration, goto: Unconditional jump (use with caution and structure)

### UNIT 3: ARRAYS, STRINGS, AND FUNCTIONS

Arrays: 1D and 2D, Discuss the matrix addition and multiplication, C++ string class vs C-style strings, String manipulation,
Functions: declaration, definition, calling, Function overloading, default arguments, recursion, Passing arrays and strings to
functions.

### UNIT 4: STRUCTURES, CLASSES, AND POINTERS

Structures in C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes and objects, constructors and destructors, Access specifiers,
member functions, Introduction to pointers, pointer arithmetic, new and delete, pointers with arrays, pointers to objects.

### UNIT 5: INHERITANCE AND FILE HANDLING

Understand the concept and purpose of inheritance, implement different types of inheritance in C++, and use access specifiers
(public, protected, private) in inheritance, I/O streams: cin, cout, cerr, clog, File I/O: ifstream, ofstream, fstream, Creating,
opening, reading, writing, and appending files, Searching and modifying file records, Error handling in file operations
