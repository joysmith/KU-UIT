# 1. Syllabus<a id='1'></a>

### UNIT 1:

Problem formulation as search/optimization; cost functions. - Uninformed search: BFS, DFS, Uniform-cost; admissibility and complexity. - Informed search: heuristics, A*, IDA*, Local search metaheuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing..

### UNIT 2:

Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP): backtracking, forward checking, MAC, MRV, constraint propagation. Game playing: minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax, evaluation functions, iterative deepening. Approximation / heuristic methods for NP-hard AI task

### UNIT 3:

Propositional logic: syntax, semantics, SAT, solving techniques.-First-order
logic: unification, resolution, inference. Rule-based reasoning: forward
chaining, backward chaining. - Planning: STRIPS, partial order planning,
heuristic planning (h-add, hmax)

### UNIT 4:

Bayesian networks: representation, factorization, CPTs. -Exact inference: variable
elimination, complexity analysis. Approximate inference: sampling methods
(ancestral, rejection, importance sampling), MCMC (Gibbs sampling), belief
propagation. -Markov networks (undirected models),

### UNIT 5:

Reinforcement Learning fundamentals: MDPs, dynamic programming
(value/policy iteration), Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient basics. Model
selection, cross-validation, overfitting vs underfitting, evaluation metrics,
computational costs.
