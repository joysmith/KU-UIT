<br>
<br>

## Objective:

<img src="../lab/assets/images/iot.png" width="300">

Design and develop a working IoT-based smart system using sensors, micro-controllers, and cloud or mobile interfaces.

This project provides practical experience in:

- Embedded systems
- Sensor integration
- Wire/Wireless communication
- Real-time monitoring
- Dashboard/app development
- Documentation & presentation

Students must build a functional prototype, not just simulation.

<br>
<br>

## Team Guidelines:

- Minimum Members: 1
- Maximum Members: 4
- Each team must choose a team leader responsible for coordination and submission.

<br>
<br>

## Allowed Tools & micro-controller:

You are free to use any micro-controller such as:

- Arduino (Uno/Nano)
- Raspberry Pi/pico/zero
- NodeMCU(ESP8266/ESP32)
- Any IoT development board

<br>
<br>
