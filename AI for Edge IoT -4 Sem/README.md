# 1. Syllabus<a id='1'></a>

### UNIT 1: Edge AI foundations & IoT systems

Edge, fog, cloud paradigms; latency, privacy and cost tradeoffs. IoT stack: sensors, microcontrollers, gateways and cloud integration. Data acquisition, streaming, lightweight preprocessing and feature extraction. Edge hardware overview: MCUs, SBCs (Raspberry Pi), NVIDIA Jetson, Coral TPUs.

### UNIT 2: Tiny and efficient ML models

Efficient CNN families (MobileNet, EfficientNet-Lite), small RNNs, efficient transformer variants. Model compression: pruning, structured sparsity, low-rank factorization, knowledge distillation. Post-training and quantization-aware training (8/16bit), mixed precision techniques. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) ideas for edge constraints.

### UNIT 3: On-device inference & Edge MLOps

On-device runtimes: TensorFlow Lite, TFLite Micro, ONNX Runtime Mobile, PyTorch Mobile. Model packaging, containerization for gateways, Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, device management. Telemetry, monitoring and lightweight federated learning paradigms for privacy.

### UNIT 4: Edge Computer Vision & time-series analytics

Low-latency CV: Tiny-YOLO, MobileNet-SSD, segmentation with light U-Nets, real-time pipelines. Time-series sensor analytics: anomaly detection, feature engineering for streaming sensors, sequence models. Case studies: predictive maintenance, wake-word detection, smart-city sensors.

### UNIT 5: Security, power management & case studies

Edge security basics: secure boot, model integrity, device attestation, adversarial considerations on edge. Energy-aware scheduling, real-time constraints and system-level co-design for ML. End-to-end case studies and deployment tradeoffs (latency vs accuracy vs energy).
