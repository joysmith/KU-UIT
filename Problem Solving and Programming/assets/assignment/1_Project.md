<br>
<br>

## Objective:

<img src="../images/project.jpg" width="700">

Design and develop a simple, Project based on C++. This project aims to provide hands-on experience in design, development, documentation, and presentation.

<br>
<br>

## Team Guidelines:

- Minimum Members: 1
- Maximum Members: 2
- Each team must choose a team leader responsible for coordination and submission.

<br>
<br>

## Allowed Tools & Engines:

You are free to use any IDE, library, framework such as:

- Standard C++ (Turbo C++, g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++ etc.)
- Any IDE/compiler students are comfortable with.

<br>
<br>

## Project Deliverables (Mandatory):

#### Each team must submit the following:

### Project Design Document

   - Brief description of the project idea.
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Why is it important or useful?

2. Project Type & Platform

   - Type of project (console-based, desktop app, database system, simulation, etc.).
   - Platform/Environment (Windows, Linux, cross-platform, etc.).

3. Target Audience

   - Who will use this project? (students, teachers, general users, businesses, etc.).
   - Skill level of intended users (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

4. Core Features & Functionality

   - List the main features.
   - Describe how the system works.
   - Inputs and expected outputs.

5. System Design / Module Design

   - Describe modules/library (e.g., login, data entry, search, report generation).
   - Use flowcharts or algorithms for clarity.

6. (OPTIONAL) User Interface (UI/UX)

   - Console menu layout or GUI mockups/wireframes.
   - User flow (start → action → output → exit).

7. Technology Stack

   - Programming language (C++).
   - Libraries/Frameworks (Standard Template Library, File Handling, OOP concepts).
   - Tools/IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, g++, etc.).

8. Testing Strategy

   - How will the project be tested? (unit testing, manual testing, edge cases).
   - Example test cases (valid input, invalid input, boundary values).

9. Future Enhancements

   - What additional features could be added in future?
   - Example: GUI support, database integration, multi-user support.
